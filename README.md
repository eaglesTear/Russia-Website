# Russia-Website
In my early days of web practice, I designed a set of pages giving information on Russian cities. 

It helped me to learn a lot in my early beginner days. Also includes a JS API for seeing how far away you are from those cities in miles.

Although containing certain errors and some iffy practices, this helped me to really get my head around HTML and CSS and contains some nice features.

An early example of my learning.
